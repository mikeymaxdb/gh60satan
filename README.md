Personal firmware for gh60 satan revchn

This is a copy of the firmware you get from https://kbfirmware.com/ when you select gh60 satan, but with an updated keymap. Looks like QMK with some modifications for the PCB. I tried using regular QMK for this pcb but it was not working for me. Hopefully this work for someone else so they don't have to program their pcbs through the websites.

Use 'make' to build the firmware. You'll get test errors but it still works. Then './flash.sh' to program the board.
